                    Cars 2 is a 2011 American animated spy comedy film[3] produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt
                    Disney Pictures. It is the sequel to Cars (2006), the second film in the Cars franchise, and the
                    12th animated film from the studio. The film was directed by John Lasseter (in his final outing as
                    director of a Pixar film to date), co-directed by Brad Lewis, produced by Denise Ream, and written
                    by Ben Queen, Lasseter, Lewis, and Dan Fogelman. In the film's ensemble voice cast, Owen Wilson,
                    Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Guido Quaroni, Bonnie Hunt, and John Ratzenberger reprise their
                    roles from the first film. George Carlin, who previously voiced Fillmore, died in 2008, and his role
                    was passed to Lloyd Sherr. They are joined by newcomers Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John
                    Turturro, Eddie Izzard, and Thomas Kretschmann. In the film, Lightning McQueen and Mater head
                    overseas to compete in the World Grand Prix which promotes a new alternative fuel called Allinol,
                    but Mater accidentally becomes involved in international espionage that could determine both his and
                    Lightning's fate.
